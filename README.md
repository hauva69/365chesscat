# zipcat

I often download chess games from a site, which serves the files as
zipped. This is somewhat clumsy.

So, a trivial script to make life a bit easier.

## Install

The command installs the script to **/usr/local/bin/zipcat**. In a
sensibly configured system you will need **sudo**.

```bash
make install
```
