# 365chesscat

[365chess.com](https://www.365chess.com/) is a good resource for games and
the staff is very responsive in case of any kind problems. However,
downloading PGN for the games is somewhat clumsy.

So, a trvial script to make life a bit easier.

## Install

The command installs the script to **/usr/local/bin/365chesscat**. In a
sensibly configured system you will need **sudo**.

```bash
make install
```
